## Tips
- **ALWAYS** draw out a tree--looking at an array will almost certainly lead to mistakes
- To quickly go from array to tree, we drop all of the nodes in as if they were a level order traversal (left to right, top to bottom)
- We completely skip all nodes that are leaves, as there isn't anything to downheap to
