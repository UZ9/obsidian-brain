# Overview
- Identical to [[Bubble Sort]], except that it bubbles to the right, and then bubbles to the left for each pass (i.e. "shaking" between bubble directions)

> [!warning] For slight confusion on what defines an "iteration" of a sort
> 
> An iteration is considered one sweep of the loop. For Bubble Sort, this is one pass of a single number being bubbled to its correct spot. For Cocktail Shaker Sort, this is **both a forward pass and a backwards pass**.
