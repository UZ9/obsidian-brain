**assembly** - basic instructions
**machine code** - computer-readable: 1's and 0's encoding instructions
**microcode** - control signals directly interacting (if machine code means "add", microcode *makes* datapath add)

Example instruction: LI "load immediate"
- "put fixed number into register"

MIPS assembly: `li $1, 123`
- "load 123 immediately into register 1"
- `$` = register
RTL (register transfer level) format: `R1 = 123`

Register R0 will **always** contain 0

- No direct connection between immediate register and register file--one potential solution is add immediate 123 and 0

Top register lane = x bus, bottom = y bus
y bus CAN be driven by immediate

Steps of architecture:
- immediate value goes into immediate register
- immediate enable = 1 to allow y bus to be controlled by immediate
- y bus set to immediate register
- arithmetic unit enable = 1 to drive z bus
- other enable units enable = 0
- addbar/sub = 0 to add numbers

Z: store into register one

# Negative Numbers
`li $1, -42`
`$1 = -42`

- Immediate register is 16 bits
- Architecture is 32 bits

Immediate values: sign extension

`-42 (111111111011010)` -> `-42 (111111111111111111111111111111011010)`
- take most significant bit and fill up empty space



##### Example Instructor: LW
"load word"

"get value from memory, using an address stored in register, and put value into register"

`lw $2, ($1)`
`R2 = MEM[R1]`

##### AND Instruction
- Derived from truth table: 0001 -> becomes 1000

##### Shift Left Logic
`sll $3, $2, 5`
`R3 = R2 SLL 5`

"take value in register 2, shift it logically 5 places, put into register 3"

##### Storin
`sw $1, ($2)` () pulls val from register
`MEM[R2] = R1`

##### Store Immediate
"store fixed value into memory at the address stored in a register"
- doesn't exist in MIPS, but possible with right microcode

`MEM[R1] = 999`

# Instruction-To-Control Decoder
ROM (read only memory):
- store microcode into ROM
- used instruction as address into ROM

Program Counter - keeps address of current instruction program is at 


##### Branch if Equal
`IF R3 = R5 GOTO [label]`
`beq $3, $5, [offset]`
- Subtracts s and t, branch if result = 0
Branch if not equal
`IF [$s] != [$t] GOTO [label]`
